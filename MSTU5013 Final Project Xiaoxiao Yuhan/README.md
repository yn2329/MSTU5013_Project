#### Project summary:
In the beginning, we set up to build a Wiki page for museum education whereas did not accomplish that due to time and technique restrain. However, we created the skeleton of a museum education website that has the potential to be refined into a real museum education page. As for the interactive aspect, we have some visual responses that were coded with CSS, and we also have a comment function that allows users to upload their ideas. All in all, we couldn't accomplish our goal but we were able to keep honing the skills we learned from last semester and we carefully integrate riot and firebase (Xiaoxiao succeed) into this page eventually.
