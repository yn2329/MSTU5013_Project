I created several tags for our final project. Within yuhan's main page, there are several options to redirect page to other designated places (educator, themes, museum) either on left side or the navbar choices (about, playground). 

I try to create links that enable the link to the new page. yuhan still working on her part; therefore, I created an index.html to help me better exam my tags


for the app.tag, I intentionally leave it blank because yuhan and I haven't integrated our project yet.
and there's my question, yuhan has a nav bar, how can i link the main page to any of the panel choice without providing hyperlink.

For the list.tag, i created a museum list, which uses a filterable table, would assist the student in finding the correct museum using exact word search or the partial will also do the job. As the museum list expand, the filterable table will be a much efficient tool. 

On the left side of the page, there s a social media navbar. Five different icons represent various social media categories, and the setting enables change once the cursor moved to the image, the color changes, and a click will redirect the page to the designated social media website. I intend to have this function repeatedly usable in every webpage we go. 

For the about.tag, just simple general information. 
i tried to use a bootstrap template, but it did not fit so well with the page. 

For the educator tag, this is a more of a page that helps the interconnected part, and i ll probably integrate educator tag along with the contact.tag.  
yuhan is really into pokemon go recently, that's why I placed these two temporary photos 

The last one is the contact.tag. I tried to create a feedback session or an online qualtrics. My initial thought was to integrated class demo 0.1.5 with mail-app, I want to create a real-time review session. As I recall, the mail-app function will gather all the information and listed accordingly, and the demo0.1.5 is a more of UI page, the answer changes once the user makes a choice. 
I am still working the on it.
