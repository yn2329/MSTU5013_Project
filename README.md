- Project Name: demo museum curriculum

#### What is the learning problem that your web-app / experience will solve?
Museum visiting is often recognized as an important extracurriculum activity for school children. As abundant as the museum resources in New York City, there is no platform out there that has all the museum curriculum prepared and organized for the school teacher to choose. Therefore, we wish to create a demo website that included school programs that created by museums. School teacher could choose the museum program based on their educational objectives. 

#### What is it that you are going to build (e.g. content, features, and user interactions afforded?)
Since this is a demo website, the museum program we present will be a pseudo- program that takes place in the pseudo-museum, meanwhile, we will use a self-developed museum education curriculum as a demonstration of the essential concept. 

The features and user interactions will involve but not restrict to the following:
1. Listing information about school programs regarding different museums. (e.g.: museums as the type while school programs as subtypes). 
2. General museum information (etiquette, transportation, dining, special accommodation etc.)
3. Two different user types: museum educators and school teachers. The museum educators could upload their school program while the school teachers could look for the information. 
3. The school teacher could book and directly contact the museum educator through this platform. More importantly, the school teachers could post their request or questions on the platform so the museum educator could help them to find the most suitable program. 
4. Wiki function: there will be a space for the museum educator to present a program that still in the design process. Other people could directly edit it, under the condition that the information is either recently developed or legit. It will be an experimental space for the educator to test their pedagogical ideas.  An educational program in the museum is intensively tight to the artworks that are on display, a 'playground' like this would allow educators from other museums to 'play' with the artwork that they do not have a chance to work on in reality. 
5. Real-time update: the home page of this website will just like any social media website that it will have a template that displays the newly update school program from museum educators.  

#### What kind of data will you need from your users (i.e. taken directly or indirectly - to collect, save, analyze, manipulate, share, etc.) and how will this relate to the user's learning?
1. We would collect and save the user information. In addition to the registered users, the website welcomes guest users to browser the webpage information. This website requires users to sign up/ log in to conduct a further interactive operation. 
2. This website will not be applicable for recommender system, therefore, there is no need to analyze the users' data in order to provide service to them. This is not a website that is trying to sell any product to the user but to provide hands-on materials and interactive experience to the users. However, to boost the community, basic demographic analysis of user will be employed. 
3. According to educational psychologist Michelene T.H. Chi that interactive learning is the most effective way to learn. In this case, both the school teachers and museum educators are learners here that not only will they learn from their peers but also they will bridge a closer relationship with teachers in another realm.
